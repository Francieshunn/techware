<strong>Debugging</strong> is simply identifying and resolving bugs in a computer program.   
<em>Steps in Debugging: </em>
1. Identifying errors
2. Finding the error location
3. Analyzing the error by trying to understand what the error really is.
4. Proving the analysis by writing automated tests with some test frameworks.
5. Run unit tests for the code.
